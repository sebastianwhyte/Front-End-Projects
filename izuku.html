            Izuku Midoriya is the main character of the popular anime and manga
            series, <i>My Hero Academia.</i>

            <br />

            Unlike most kids his age, 14 year old Izuku was born without a
            quirk. While growing up, he has looked up to All Might, a legendary
            hero. After meeting, he agrees to put timid Izuku through 10 months
            of training. Impressed by Izuku's dedication, All Might transfers
            the quirk, 'One for All' onto his new pupil.

            <br />
            Izuku must learn to control to his new powerful quirk to fight
            against villians and prove himself to his fellow UA peers. He soon
            will become the world's greatest hero.

          <h2>Abilities</h2>
          <p>
            <b><u>One For All</u></b> - This quirk was transferred from All
            Might onto Izuku, who was quirkless at the time. One For All gives
            Izuku superhuman strength and speed. While using this quirk, Izuku
            can release gusts of wind, destroy objects and jump far into the
            air. As a way to prevent this powerful quirk from being overused,
            One For All will break bones of whatever body part was used. In
            order to prevent this, Izuku can only use 20% of its full power.

            <br />
            <br />

            <b><u>Black Whip</u></b> - This is Izuku's second quirk. Like One
            For All, Izuku inherited this quirk. Black Whip allows Izuku to
            release dark energy from his arms.
