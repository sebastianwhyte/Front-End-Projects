                  This is my first sample webpage that focuses on my favorite
                  anime,
                  <i>NARUTO</i>. Originally published in Japan, the manga was
                  written by the then 25 year-old Masashi Kishimoto.
                  <i>Naruto</i> made its debut in the
                  <i>Weekly Shonen Jump 1999</i>. The manga rapidly gained
                  popularity and was adapted into two animated series,
                  <i>NARUTO</i> and <i>NARUTO: Shippuden</i>. As of 2020, the
                  <i>NARUTO</i> manga has sold over 250 million copies worldwide
                  and the anime (both original and Shippuden) have 720 episodes
                  altogether.

                <p>
                  Naruto is a 12 year-old boy living in Konohagakure, also known
                  as 'The Village Hidden in The Leaves' or "Hidden Leaf
                  Village". Shortly after his birth, a giant nine-tailed demon
                  fox raged havoc on Konoha. Following an intense battle, the
                  Fourth Hokage sacrificed himself and sealed the demon fox
                  within Naruto's body. Because of this, Naruto is ostracized
                  from his fellow villagers. Regardless of the obstacles he's
                  encountered during his life, Naruto is determined to fufill
                  his dream: becoming Hokage.
