# beginner-projects
I'm new to programming and I'm learning how to make projects. Some of them might have comments I've made for myself to help myself learn, don't mind them.

This repository will have a collection of simple projects I've finished. I'm open to suggestions and learning new tips. 
If you see this and have project ideas, let me know!
Thanks for looking.
